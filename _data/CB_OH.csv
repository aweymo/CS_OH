So they go around, and of course, their own families and their friends, they go around because wherever they go they receive a little package of money wrapped in red paper on this few 7 a days of the New Year. But when you were in Walla Walla and growing up, were there-- were most of the families there-— yer Men. Mostly men. Most of the Chinese-- there was just two women 2 that Just two women think is all. There was three hundred and some men. there was. Somebody's wife-— two families. And most of the men were in the Well, yeah, they used to be railroad in the early day,  but when the railroad quit then they got into the  farming business. They got into the agriculture, see.  Vegetable farming. They'd get a couple of acres and  they go plant vegetables and then sell the vegetables. Did many of them work in the orchards? No, not too many work in the orchard.Not too many in  the orchard. There was an apple orchard- Not too many orchards in Walla Walla. There was an apple orchard that was considered big,  but they never did Why did the kids come to America  instead of staying in China with the mothers? Why did  they come with the fathers? Well, they come with the father because-- You see the  father came over on the railroad here at that | time. They only usually -- the boys-- because they could  take care of boys easier than having a girl along. They come to America because they considered it a  land of opportunity. They come over here-- one reason  is--they can make one dollar then they get ﬁve dollars back there. But what American exchange you  save one American dollar, you get ﬁve dollars back in Chinese  money. At that time the ﬁve dollars would actually buy more  stuff than the American one dollar. Actually, back there. They  living, be like the--so therefore, you see, at that time, when  came the railroad was ﬁnished. The railroad was ﬁnished, the  Chinese was just kind of converging one into the other a little  bit. And so, therefore-- right after the railroad I. think the  government won't let the Chinese come in anyway-the women  come in anyway. In the ﬁrst place the Chinese Government  didn't want their wives to go. Then after that when the Chinese  Government don't mind so much- when the Boxer'’s uprising  and then they open up the west to China, then the American  Government don't want the Chinese people to move in here.  So the gates was kinda closed in one end or the other. So the  boys-- we had to come in-- most of the time-- a lot of Chinese  come in as a general rule had to fake a name or something in  order to say they are citizens or something like that. That's  why a lot of Chinese people are that way, through that,  because they only allow a hundred and eighteen a year. A  year, they only allow that much. Where any country in the  world they'd allow thousands a year, they only allow a hundred  and eighteen a year. So they have to ﬁb, you know. ""My  father's so-and-so,"" in order to do that.  At the time when you came in was it the same way? Yeah. I came in as a citizen's son. Wf mean, not citizen's son,  a merchant's son. My father was supposed to do ‘business  here as a merchant, and therefore, I came in as a son to go to  school. I did, I went to school. I went through all the years of  school here. No. My father'd been here before. My fathers here before on  the rai Was that his ﬁrst time here? road. When would you guess he was ﬁrst here? Oh, it was 18-~- something. He worked on the railroad building in the Northwest? Well, I don't know too much about that. My Uncle did, yeah. 1800 something. Then my father went back, I  think 1800 something. Then went back to China. Must be  ten, ﬁfteen years, I think. Then he decided When he was  to come back. That's all. in China during that time, then he got married. Yeah, he got married. I imagine when he come over, did he come over with his  father, too: No. He just come over as a young man. A  laborer. He didn't do mining? He worked on the railroad. No, the railroad. The mining was afterwards. The people  of China -the Chinese people are not very good miners,  because they never had mining in China, that way, see.  And so, they came over as a railroad workers as  Laborers. They even tell them, dig ditches and stuff, that’s  ﬁne. But as miners, we have no experience. But after the  railroad ‘built, then they have to do something. Then they  got the idea to go out, you know they go pan gold. At that time they don't have any more jobs with the  railroad, so they had to do something else. Do something to create a job for themself to get, to eat. have to do something else. Do you think that when your father came to China the ﬁrst  time that he had done well, as far as-- Did he have-- had  he made money? Actually here to bring back? Was he in  good shape! Well, he was, I would say, -- You don't have to do very  much to do better than those people in China. The people  in China are practically-they're living from hand-to-mouth,  they're like Indians. A quarter of land, maybe.  Like Indian. But, of course, he work hard and I think he  maybe-- l would say, he save maybe ﬁve or six hundred  dollars and he work probably for ﬁve, six years, something  like that. I think he worked longer than that in fact. The ﬁrst  time, he worked longer than that, he came over because   my mother is quite a bit younger than my father, so I  imagine he was over I didn't talk to him so much at that  time, I was young. I think you said that your father didn’t marry until after he  was thirty. Some thirty some year old. My mother was quite  a bit younger than he. And he saved about ﬁve or six hundred dollars. And, of  course, that's ﬁve or six hundred dollars more than  anybody back there had, you know, So, he went back, you at the time when he went back. know. And, of course, we have a little land back [End of  Side A) there too. And my grandfather-- ——- food for the family, see. And then he was doing fairly  good in China. He was making a fairly living, I would say. Not good as  here, but a It was all farming?living. Yes. He was farming and he was in business too. He was  in the drugstore business there in China for a while. Then,  of course, he was partner in it. And the drugstore business  did real good, but at that time ,didn't pay off very good.  What mage him come back was-- at that time they have a  lot of robbers. A whole bunch of bandit? come in and take  everything out of your house. Clean you right out. Living in the village there. Yeah, in the village. They just took it all. You had to buy  new furniture.

","He was working in the Railroad. He get only three  dollars a day, eight hours work. And then myself too, so I stay  with him. Still they pay rent too, living in the bunkhouses over  there, in Grays Harbor. he pay rent maybe two and a half dollars a month, there are so  many of them living in.the bunkhouses. And then they share  the rent of the bunkhouse and light bills... and they share with the groceries. So, the most grocery of one  person for about a month is about twelve-thirteen dollars  everything, a month. Ms. Cronin:. You have some place to cook there? Mr. Madayag: Well, everybody cook. If you're assigned to cook,  you cook. Maybe cabbage and hamburger, that's it. Ms. Cronin: What was the boat trip like? Mr. Madayag: What boat. Ms. Cronin: When you were coming over. Ms. Cronin: Of Russia? Mr. Madayag: that is a big boat. Empress of Russia. Mr. Madayag: Yeah. Empress of Russia. That was a big boat.  There were SO many of us there it takes us 21 days traveling,  not including the stop in every port see. About 30 days  altogether to get here. Ms. Cronin; Anyone get sick? That's a long time. Mr. Madayag: Oh sure.: Several of them get sick and one died  too. And they dump it in the sea, Paciﬁc anyway. And so they  dump it in the sea.There was a preacher there too, Just like a  priest. So after the ceremony they dump it like that, just like  that. Ms. Cronin: Did you have a lot bf friends come over with you? Mr. Madayag: Oh there are lots of us leaving with.one another  in our barrio And we were about 295 altogether of us on that like this. ve call it barrio, ina OW of so many houses. We were ﬁve. ship, to come over here, Filipino anyway. And then when I get  to Grays Harbor, I think I was there in page 4 the meridian, in the middle of the ocean I get seasick, and I was so  sick when IT get here, that I stayed home where my brother is for a  lot, for about eleven days, to get better. . And then I get a chance to  work in the sawmill that time. And my work there in the sawmill is to  strip those lumbers, anyway. Only three dollars and a quarter a day,  And then in 1931-32 the wages drop down to two and a half a day.  When after that no more work, that's the Depression time. So I went  to Seattle and stay in Seattle and go work farm in Auborn, Kent  anyway, for ﬁfteen cents an hour. And then it drops to, yeah, ﬁfteen  cents an hour, and then in 1932, that's when I came here, one  Japanese I met there in Seattle was from here in this Island, and  then he was hiring and you know how much he told me he'll pay? He  told me he'll pay nine cents per hour and I give you rice to cook. All  the rest on your feeding you buy it yourself. If you work I'll pay you  nine cents."" So, I work. For about, not less than a year anyway. So I  used to go to Alaska cannery. Ms. Cronin: When was the ﬁrst year you went up to Alaska? Mr. Madayag: 1934. 1934 and then 65 dollars a month.) Go for two  months, that's hundred-thirty, for two months. And then after that we  come to Seattle and we boys, young boys yet, we don't care,  sometimes we got money. today and tomorrow we got no money,  because we gamble with those Chinese people there in Seattle. So  you. know what's a gambler. Sometimes you got money right now,  but maybe this afternoon you got no more money. If you can hit it a  dime or a quarter from your friend then you start gambling again,  then @& you win, then you will have some money. Ms. Cronin: Did you ever live in Chinatown? Mr. Madayag: - Sure. that's where I live, in Chinatown. You know how much I pay for one  week? Dollar a week. | Ms. Cronin: Rent? i i Mr. Madayag: .Rent. In the hotel. They change your bedsheets once  a week, page 5 anyway. And then that time we are not doing anything, I stay  there in | Chinatown, I used to go ﬁshing in the dock, ferry  dock, there around the Port of Seattle.. And those shiners,  and we cook them and that's what Ms. Cronin: Did. they  have a ferry boat that went back and forth all the time then? Mr. Madayag: What ferry boat where? Ms. Cronin: You know that one we have now, .-they have a  little ferry boat ride: Mr. Madayag: Sure. We got, we don't have no ferry boat  there in Winslow. We don't have no ferry boat there in  Winslow. What we have ferry boat is Port Blakely. That's a  Port Blakely ferry boat. And then there is a ferry boat there in  Manitou Bay, and then go around the Island like that.  Seabold, ferry boat there. And then after a while it comes to  here in Manzanita. And that's it. It go back again to Seattle,  that way. And I think it was thirty ﬁve ‘cents, one way. ‘Thirty- ﬁve cents one way back in 1936. 1936 I don't know, 1932, I  forgot now. Ms. Cronin: When you ﬁrst got off the boat, when you ﬁrst  Landed in the United States, you went right to Grays Harbor? Mr. Madayag: Yeah. ‘Ms. Cronin: And then you didn't. go to Chinatown then, until  you started going up.to Alaska and coming back down? Mr. Madayag: I only went to Seattle when there's. no more in  the sawmill. The sawmill stop because no business, that  time. Ms: Cronin: That's about '34 then? Mr. Madayag: Yeah,. And then sometimes I stay in Seattle, I  get into barber shop, work in a barber. shop as.a barber. And  I only get a shave and hair cutting only 25¢: And I get ﬁfteen  cents and the shop get ten cents. Japanese: ‘forest rice paddy’; mostly found in the island of Kyushu. page 6 Some bearers are descendedfrom the Minamoto clan. Ms. Cronin: Was that enough to live on Mr. Madayag: No: One sack of rice cost around three dollars. That will  get x you about a month and a half to use that sack of rice.. If you eat  rice in the morning, rice noontime, rice in the nighttime - If you get money  maybe hamburger _ ten cents a pound. That hamburger I think you eat  that three times mixed with cabbage chop the cabbage and mix it with  hamburger. Ms. Cronin: And then go ﬁshing too? Mr. Madayag: Go ﬁshing in the, because we got no boat to go in the  water. Still when I com here, these Hiashida people here, (they are one  of the richest people, Japanese here, and they don""t even, they only  ""torogotog "" Car. You know. what's torogoteg car? That junk. ‘That car  sitting there is even better. Ms. Cronin: How do you say that work you just told me? Mr . Madayag: What's Torogotog? Torogotog car. Junk. Ms. Cronin: I'll have you write that down. for me later. Mr . Madayag: Torogotog. Junk we call it there, that's Philippine lingo.  Torogotog. Junk. Ms. Cronin: They just had a bad car and they. were the richest? Mr. Madayag: Yeah. It could hardly run. And when we were here we like  to go dig clams, we even walk from Hiashida to Fletcher's Bay, and carry  the clams Ms, Cronin: Is that who you were picking berries for? Mr. Madayag: Yeah, I work there and I work SO many, how many of  them, one, Hiashida, Koura, Matsushita, Futokawa, yeah; yeah, those  are the Japanese people I work for. And then it comes to 1936. We were  getting 17 cents and a * half per hour now then. And then I belong to the  Cannery and Farm Union in Seattle so I was forced to look for a better  way of working here. But then the Japanese had made the berries before  at maybe six, six-seven cents.a pound, before. So I was forced to ask  more per hour here in the farm because I belong page 7 to the Cannery and Farm Labor Union in Seattle. So I led the  strike of the workers here, mostly of the Filipino boys and Max  Avi is my secretary too. Ms. Cronin: Who was your secretary? Mr. Madayag: Max, you know that fellow that always come over  here with the red car? And I think he was the ﬁrst Filipino here. Ms. Cronin: : What's his Last name? Mr. Madayag: Max Avi. Ms. Cronin: AV? Mr, Madayag: Yeah. Ms. Cronin: ‘Tell me about Mr. Madayag : Strike for the worker. ‘To ask for more money by  the hour. So... Ms. Cronin: ‘This was in 1936?   Mr. Madayag: Yeah. 1936. And then we ask about twenty-ﬁve  cents. All seventeen cents and a half, and then they give us  twenty-ﬁve cents. Ms.-Cronin: Oh, they gave it to your Mr. Madayag: Yeah. Ms. Cronin: Did a lot of the farms that Filipinos struck or only the  one you were working on? Mr. Madayag: No Filipinos farmers here yet, before. | Ms. Cronin: No, I mean the workers, the Filipino workers. — Mr. Madayag: Yeah, mostly Filipino workers are working for the  Japanese people. Ms. Cronin: But only the farm you were on, or all the rest of the  farms the workers struck also. Mr. Madayag: Yeah all over, the worker of the Japanese here,  see  Ms.-Cronin: No one ever told me about that. Mr. Madayag: Yeah.

So I went  to Seattle and stay in Seattle and go work farm in Auborn, Kent  anyway, for ﬁfteen cents an hour. And then it drops to, yeah, ﬁfteen  cents an hour, and then in 1932, that's when I came here, one  Japanese I met there in Seattle was from here in this Island, and  then he was hiring and you know how much he told me he'll pay? He  told me he'll pay nine cents per hour and I give you rice to cook. All  the rest on your feeding you buy it yourself. If you work I'll pay you  nine cents."" So, I work. For about, not less than a year anyway. So I  used to go to Alaska cannery. Ms. Cronin: When was the ﬁrst year you went up to Alaska? Mr. Madayag: 1934. 1934 and then 65 dollars a month.) Go for two  months, that's hundred-thirty, for two months. And then after that we  come to Seattle and we boys, young boys yet, we don't care,  sometimes we got money. today and tomorrow we got no money,  because we gamble with those Chinese people there in Seattle. So  you. know what's a gambler. Sometimes you got money right now,  but maybe this afternoon you got no more money. If you can hit it a  dime or a quarter from your friend then you start gambling again,  then @& you win, then you will have some money. Ms. Cronin: Did you ever live in Chinatown? Mr. Madayag: - Sure. that's where I live, in Chinatown. You know how much I pay for one  week? Dollar a week. | Ms. Cronin: Rent? i i Mr. Madayag: .Rent. In the hotel. They change your bedsheets once  a week, page 5 anyway. And then that time we are not doing anything, I stay  there in | Chinatown, I used to go ﬁshing in the dock, ferry  dock, there around the Port of Seattle.. And those shiners,  and we cook them and that's what Ms. Cronin: Did. they  have a ferry boat that went back and forth all the time then? Mr. Madayag: What ferry boat where? Ms. Cronin: You know that one we have now, .-they have a  little ferry boat ride: Mr. Madayag: Sure. We got, we don't have no ferry boat  there in Winslow. We don't have no ferry boat there in  Winslow. What we have ferry boat is Port Blakely. That's a  Port Blakely ferry boat. And then there is a ferry boat there in  Manitou Bay, and then go around the Island like that.  Seabold, ferry boat there. And then after a while it comes to  here in Manzanita. And that's it. It go back again to Seattle,  that way. And I think it was thirty ﬁve ‘cents, one way. ‘Thirty- ﬁve cents one way back in 1936. 1936 I don't know, 1932, I  forgot now. Ms. Cronin: When you ﬁrst got off the boat, when you ﬁrst  Landed in the United States, you went right to Grays Harbor? Mr. Madayag: Yeah. ‘Ms. Cronin: And then you didn't. go to Chinatown then, until  you started going up.to Alaska and coming back down? Mr. Madayag: I only went to Seattle when there's. no more in  the sawmill. The sawmill stop because no business, that  time. Ms: Cronin: That's about '34 then? Mr. Madayag: Yeah,. And then sometimes I stay in Seattle, I  get into barber shop, work in a barber. shop as.a barber. And  I only get a shave and hair cutting only 25¢: And I get ﬁfteen  cents and the shop get ten cents. Japanese: ‘forest rice paddy’; mostly found in the island of Kyushu. page 6 Some bearers are descendedfrom the Minamoto clan. Ms. Cronin: Was that enough to live on Mr. Madayag: No: One sack of rice cost around three dollars. That will  get x you about a month and a half to use that sack of rice.. If you eat  rice in the morning, rice noontime, rice in the nighttime - If you get money  maybe hamburger _ ten cents a pound. That hamburger I think you eat  that three times mixed with cabbage chop the cabbage and mix it with  hamburger. Ms. Cronin: And then go ﬁshing too? Mr. Madayag: Go ﬁshing in the, because we got no boat to go in the  water. Still when I com here, these Hiashida people here, (they are one  of the richest people, Japanese here, and they don""t even, they only  ""torogotog "" Car. You know. what's torogoteg car? That junk. ‘That car  sitting there is even better. Ms. Cronin: How do you say that work you just told me? Mr . Madayag: What's Torogotog? Torogotog car. Junk. Ms. Cronin: I'll have you write that down. for me later. Mr . Madayag: Torogotog. Junk we call it there, that's Philippine lingo.  Torogotog. Junk. Ms. Cronin: They just had a bad car and they. were the richest? Mr. Madayag: Yeah. It could hardly run. And when we were here we like  to go dig clams, we even walk from Hiashida to Fletcher's Bay, and carry  the clams Ms, Cronin: Is that who you were picking berries for? Mr. Madayag: Yeah, I work there and I work SO many, how many of  them, one, Hiashida, Koura, Matsushita, Futokawa, yeah; yeah, those  are the Japanese people I work for. And then it comes to 1936. We were  getting 17 cents and a * half per hour now then. And then I belong to the  Cannery and Farm Union in Seattle so I was forced to look for a better  way of working here. But then the Japanese had made the berries before  at maybe six, six-seven cents.a pound, before. So I was forced to ask  more per hour here in the farm because I belong page 7 to the Cannery and Farm Labor Union in Seattle. So I led the  strike of the workers here, mostly of the Filipino boys and Max  Avi is my secretary too. Ms. Cronin: Who was your secretary? Mr. Madayag: Max, you know that fellow that always come over  here with the red car? And I think he was the ﬁrst Filipino here. Ms. Cronin: : What's his Last name? Mr. Madayag: Max Avi. Ms. Cronin: AV? Mr, Madayag: Yeah. Ms. Cronin: ‘Tell me about Mr. Madayag : Strike for the worker. ‘To ask for more money by  the hour. So... Ms. Cronin: ‘This was in 1936?   Mr. Madayag: Yeah. 1936. And then we ask about twenty-ﬁve  cents. All seventeen cents and a half, and then they give us  twenty-ﬁve cents. Ms.-Cronin: Oh, they gave it to your Mr. Madayag: Yeah. Ms. Cronin: Did a lot of the farms that Filipinos struck or only the  one you were working on? Mr. Madayag: No Filipinos farmers here yet, before. | Ms. Cronin: No, I mean the workers, the Filipino workers. — Mr. Madayag: Yeah, mostly Filipino workers are working for the  Japanese people. Ms. Cronin: But only the farm you were on, or all the rest of the  farms the workers struck also. Mr. Madayag: Yeah all over, the worker of the Japanese here,  see  Ms.-Cronin: No one ever told me about that. Mr. Madayag: Yeah. So I led the strike, then sitting down strike  in those bunkhouse of the Japanese. We don't go to work. ",7/2/75,Filipino;  Fishing; Agriculture; Transportation ,"Grays Harbor, Washington",47.14445,-123.82847,Washington State Archives,TM_Excerpt_Transcript.pdf,Image;StillImage,application/pdf,,Virginia R.

W: I know that in that area of town, there were also a lot of the  Scandinavians and mostly Scandinavians in that area,. did your  community ever have any problems, with the Scandinavians in town? C: Well I never heard really because the Italian people as a rule, are  very friendly people. And even if the Scandinavians felt superior or  what I don't know. I don't think they had a chance to be antagonistic  or unfriendly with the people, they were very friendly.

He couldn't work with  them. He knew that he wasn't wanted there because he was an  Italian and they were Scandinavian people. But outside of that I  don't know of any other really antagonism. We got along ﬁne, in  fact, I had more Scandinavian friends around here since I've been  here. And never had any problems with anyone. W: What kind of work as there available for the Italian community?  C: For most of them it was ditch digging. They couldn't speak but  they could work and they were willing to work. Naturally as they got  to know the language a little bit they were able to go here and there  and look for a better job. I know my husband was very frail and very  delicate.

He couldn't work with  them. He knew that he wasn't wanted there because he was an  Italian and they were Scandinavian people. But outside of that I  don't know of any other really antagonism. We got along ﬁne, in  fact, I had more Scandinavian friends around here since I've been  here. And never had any problems with anyone. W: What kind of work as there available for the Italian community?  C: For most of them it was ditch digging. They couldn't speak but  they could work and they were willing to work. Naturally as they got  to know the language a little bit they were able to go here and there  and look for a better job. I know my husband was very frail and very  delicate. His brother recommended him to some Italian that was in  charge of the railroad gangs, and he was working there but he  couldn't keep up with them. He was ﬁfteen years old and he used to  tell me when he came here that he had been very sick and they  expected him to die. He had the small pox and he was so sick, they  even ordered a cofﬁn, then he changed for the better and his  brother got sick and they used the cofﬁn for him. His brother was l1/  yrs old. So when he came here he was very delicate and a person  who did more studying than digging in the yard so he couldn't work  and he got ﬁred. Went back to Connecticut where he had another  brother there and he worked in the Arrow Company, factory where  they were making, I think, the name was the Arrow, but I can't  remember what they were doing, but when I went back there ",11/13/75,"Italian; Land Development,; Transportation","Tacoma, WA",47.25288,-122.44429,Tacoma Public Library Northwest Room,MSC_Excerpt_Transcript.pdf,Image;StillImage,application/pdf,,Elizabeth Farris,eng,NON-COMMERCIAL USE PERMITTED,https://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/?language=en,,,

","Of course she had children of her own. But the  hunchback, there was Stake Leaf, he was a young man, he had a  wife. And this was so far back it went into a legend, she couldn't  catch the hunchback so she would throw rocks at him and all those  little hills are her rocks. So this history is a way back, we don't  know time ﬂies by according to, we don't know how long the days  or the months were all about but I know that history's back there. Where the Indian comes from, we don't know but that is the  background of where I happen to be a Swinomish. W: What did your family do, to make your living when you were on  the S: Well, they, when I came, ﬁshing was the main thing. Fishing. reservation? The ﬁrst time, I remember we went to Lopez Island and there was  two families, Bob Edwards and Billy Edwards, there were seniors,  they had two half brothers Charlie and Dick Edwards. They were  from Swinomish, Dick Edwards and then, their mother was from  the Swinomish, their father Amish, come from Dumish Island The  cannery was started over here, west of Anacortes and so they had  these people here, they gave them, they had reef nets long before  the coming of the white man so, these two brothers, four brothers  got together and they went up to Lopez island: and their ﬁsh nets  and they were so primitive. I guess at that time I was around four  or ﬁve, anyhow, as I remember it. I laugh about it once in awhile.  They gave them ropes and nets, anchors, so they could anchor  these reef nets, these people so primitive, they said that Sock Eye  would not follow the net, they'd have to make ropes twisted cedar  to make ropes . They (Laughs) They didn't wouldn't use anchors,  they would use big boulders. catch a lot of ﬁsh, thats the ﬁrst time I went ﬁshing, and to go on  with that story, I remember that, there was a big ﬁeld day, it used to  be in Olympia for quite a while, the ranchers around here were  settling, oh there was Apple Creek and so on and anyhow they had  a ball ﬁeld where they had been ﬁshing, ﬁrst catch from this here reef net, they roasted them then they was a  procession clear around this ball ﬁeld, and they were singing the  tunes of this sock eye, because this sock eye, was a relative of  theirs going back into the sea where the, one of the Samish girls  had married into the people from the Sea. The land of the Sock  Eye Salmond so they were giving thanks to the spirit who  brought the salmon, they went clear around and they came  back, then they spread everything on the head tables and  spread it on the ground there, everybody ate. When they got  through eating and there was a big baseball game, but the thing  is that they still believe in they had to have the ways that the  spirit guide, they had a spirit guide that helped them with their  ﬁshing. But then they continued, after the ﬁshing was or the  Cannery was developed many canneries came in there. My folks  worked up there every summer. One summer we was over to  Chuckman Bay, there was a Cannery there. I worked there for ﬁve cents an hour, put tins on top of these  cans of salmon, we used to have to puncture the top of the can,  where the steam came in, then they solder it afterwards, well  this little piece of tin we put on there to keep the solder from  going into the ﬁsh meat, well that was my job, ﬁve cents an hour,  put in ten hours at a time, I've been working since I was that  small, but then I got work when I was fourteen I left from there. But then I had learned something about this ﬁshing camp, steam  and so on and so on, well that was the main thing. Of course,  they went hop picking When the ﬁshermen wasn't working, he'd  come up here to Puyallup. 1903, was the last time we come. But  that was the main thing, ﬁsheries, hopping and of course the  younger men, some worked in the logging camps and the  lumber mills, but my parents worked at the ﬁsheries. W: Last time that I was here, you mentioned that your uncle was  a medicine S: Oh yes, in the village where we lived, where: we,  on the east side, amongst this allotment, there was a village  settlement in there with the 9:1l-l1sp.6 radius of about oh, a little over quarter of a mile. There were seven houses within that area. People lived there, out of the seven houses there were ﬁve medicine men. My Uncle Jim, was the youngest. That's where we commence to working was right above their place, How I happen to ﬁnd out, of course we used to go, somebody was sick in Canada someplace and they'd ask my parents, they were good singers, to go up and keep time, beating on the sticks you know, and whatever it was, to keep time with these songs, so it basically gives the spirit more power to overcome the evil spirit. So one day mother and I, we went across the Swinomish Channel, we went to a farmer out there. And we come to a post and she said, ""What's that son?"" And I said, ""That's an ad from the store down there about what they’ were.selling.""’ She said, “Take that and master it, we're slaves to this new country. Master that, and you'll be successful."" And she said, ""Look at my cousin, Thomas Williams, he went to school, and ﬁnished this semester course up ‘here at Catholic Mission School in Tulalip. Mrs. Preston. She went on talking about who was successful. ""But you don't want to forget your background. Once in awhile, we go out and fast for a day or two, away from the habitat, up in the mountains where you can by and sit out on the Islands and bathe and pray not that you would become, but because nature will know you. Stranded some place, if the nature knows you, your not gonna get sick and die, you'll live So that. has been my livelihood, so my mother says, “look at your Uncle, his medicine is good as any.: I had two aunts, medicine was on both sides of the family which didn’t do us any good so the new culture is the thing. That was the very beginning. W: Can you describe for me what it was like when you started to school? Did you speak English when you started, the school on the reservation? S: No, I could say, ""Yeah"" and ""No"", thats all I knew, (Laughs) The language was very much in Indian especially in that neighborhood, except what mother tells me about these people. But anyhow, these Indians, who understood the language, even if they didn't go to school, understood  enough to speak with other, the English language, theres very little  Chinook (Jargon) It wasn't there language at all. English in our Skagit  language, before I forget, a version of the Skagit language, or  dialect of the Skagit language was understood from Olympia clear to  South Bellingham, similar dialects were developed, the accent was  different. The Puyallups and the Nisquallies have similar accents. Up in  parts on the Skagit River Valley, there was a difference of how they  spoke much like say the difference of England and someone from  Georgia. But they understood each other. We went to school, that's all I  knew. But the teacher, she was very patient, she was, she knew what  she was doing. We had a teacher for a little while I think she was a  stenographer, a stenographer's wife. I forgot what her name was now,  she used to draw on the board, we had blackboards all around the  school house. She'd draw images. We had a number of pupils, instead  of going back to the Tulalip school, the mission school, they stayed and  went to school here. We had to walk to school, walk over to school and  the older boys and girls, would say, come on, we got to get there a  certain time. If we didn't, we'd forget and start playing around. But anyhow we made  it. But the thing was, when we only went up to the fourth grade, thats as  far as we went. When I got to the fourth rade I stayed there, I don't know  what year was I got to the fourth grade but I stayed there, all these  young people left the reservation and went to some other place, they  got married and so on and left, sixteen and around there, ﬁfteen and  sixteen, and the boys were only seventeen and eighteen, and I stayed  there. But ﬁnally in 1904, this Mr. Potter. My ‘Aunt Lucy, oh there were  two pupils right from the fourth, there was Charles Billy, and Mrs.  (Name) Thomas McCloud, Lucy McCloud who went to Chemawa. They  put in three years. a piece and came back. Lucy got to be there and  was assistant matron and after that she went to Haskell.

","W : Well then were most of the people who came about the time that your parents moved  here to Tacoma, were most of them peasants?  C: They were mostly from peasant stock. There opportunities for education in Poland were  limited, .20me of the area that was occupied I can speak of my parents area which was  under Russia; the youngster went to school in the morning, in Russian and went to school  in the morning and in the afternoon they were allowed to use Polish. The amount of  education was limited so the Poles would not be in the position to raise much opposition.  to the occupying forces. They were not permitted to/acquire new new some cases, to take lands. In fact the occupying country tried the  land""and turn it over to their favorites, either from Russia and among  the Poles that might be supportive of their efforts.The people who  came here were looking for a chance primarily to get a place to make a  living, fo acquire land. They had very little to offer in the way of jobs. In  other words they were limited pretty much to ﬁnding work they could  do with their hands. And so many of them ended up in the mines  around Black Diamond, Carbonado and Wilkeson. a place called Fairfax you don't ﬁnd on the maps any more. Then some more found  work in the lumber mills in the tide ﬂats. here in Tacoma.

","W : Well then were most of the people who came about the time that your parents moved  here to Tacoma, were most of them peasants?  C: They were mostly from peasant stock. There opportunities for education in Poland were  limited, .20me of the area that was occupied I can speak of my parents area which was  under Russia; the youngster went to school in the morning, in Russian and went to school  in the morning and in the afternoon they were allowed to use Polish. The amount of  education was limited so the Poles would not be in the position to raise much opposition.  to the occupying forces. They were not permitted to/acquire new new some cases, to take lands. In fact the occupying country tried the  land""and turn it over to their favorites, either from Russia and among  the Poles that might be supportive of their efforts.The people who  came here were looking for a chance primarily to get a place to make a  living, fo acquire land. They had very little to offer in the way of jobs. In  other words they were limited pretty much to ﬁnding work they could  do with their hands. And so many of them ended up in the mines  around Black Diamond, Carbonado and Wilkeson. a place called Fairfax you don't ﬁnd on the maps any more. Then some more found  work in the lumber mills in the tide ﬂats. here in Tacoma.
